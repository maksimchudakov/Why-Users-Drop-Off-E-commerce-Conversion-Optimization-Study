## 📌 Project Overview

A multi-dimensional A/B test analysis conducted on an e-commerce platform to evaluate whether a **redesigned landing page** drives higher conversion rates compared to the existing design.

Rather than stopping at aggregate results, this study applies **segmentation analysis** across user behavioral dimensions — uncovering a critical insight that top-level metrics completely missed: the new design **actively harms conversion rates among returning users**, putting an estimated **$548,332 in annual revenue at risk.**

## 🎯 Business Question

> *"Does the new landing page design statistically improve conversion rates — and does this hold across all user segments?"*

## 📊 Key Findings

| Dimension | Result |
|---|---|
| Dataset Size | 290,584 clean user sessions |
| Aggregate Result | ❌ Not significant (p = 0.19) |
| New User Segment | ❌ Not significant (p = 0.74) |
| Returning User Segment | ✅ Significant negative effect (p = 0.028) |
| Conversion Impact | -0.37% drop for returning users |
| Annual Revenue at Risk | $548,332 |

## 🔍 The Core Insight

The aggregate A/B test returned an **inconclusive result** — suggesting no meaningful difference between the two pages. However, segmentation analysis revealed a critical divergence:

- **New Users** — No significant impact from the new design
- **Returning Users** — Statistically significant **conversion rate decline** of 0.37%

This is a classic example of how **top-level metrics can mask opposing segment-level effects** — and why segmentation is essential before any deployment decision.

---

## 💡 Final Recommendation

> **Do not launch the new landing page globally.** Implement a segmented experience — preserve the current page for returning users and conduct qualitative research to understand friction points before the next experiment iteration.
